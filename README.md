# Mazefinder

A simple maze solver that uses Breath-First-Search(BFS) or Depth-First-Algorithm(DFS) to solve a maze. 

This project is uses python programming language and pygame library.

##Goal 
-To visulaize algorithm such as BFS and DFS in an interactive way.
-To understand algorithms such as BFS and DFS

##Future Goals
-Make the solver more user-friendly so people can add mazes of different sizes
